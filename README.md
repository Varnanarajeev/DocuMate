# DocuMate ðŸ“„ðŸ¤–

DocuMate is a Streamlit-based application designed to provide intelligent document search and question-answering capabilities using vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs). With DocuMate, users can upload PDF files, which the app then processes to answer questions based on document content.

## Features
- **PDF Uploads**: Upload multiple PDF documents for analysis.
- **Document Splitting**: Splits documents into chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Generates embeddings for fast document retrieval.
- **Question Answering**: Provides accurate answers to user questions based on document content.
- **Document Similarity Search**: Retrieves similar document chunks based on context.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure to have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DocuMate.git
   cd DocuMate
Usage
Run the Streamlit App:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Upload PDF Files:

Use the file uploader in the app to upload PDF files for analysis.
Ask Questions:

Enter questions related to the document content in the text input box.
Click the "Submit" button to generate answers based on document content.
Document Similarity Search:

Access similar document chunks within the "Document Similarity Search" expander.
