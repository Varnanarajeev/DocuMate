# DocuMate ðŸ“„ðŸ¤–

DocuMate is a Streamlit-based application designed to provide intelligent document search and question-answering capabilities using vector embeddings and large language models (LLMs). With DocuMate, users can upload PDF files, which the app then processes to answer questions based on document content.

## Features
- **PDF Uploads**: Upload multiple PDF documents for analysis.
- **Document Splitting**: Splits documents into chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Embeddings**: Generates embeddings for fast document retrieval.
- **Question Answering**: Provides accurate answers to user questions based on document content.
- **Document Similarity Search**: Retrieves similar document chunks based on context.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure to have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit

- ## About the LLM Model

DocuMate uses a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to deliver accurate and context-aware responses to questions based on document content. LLMs are sophisticated AI models trained on vast datasets, enabling them to understand and generate human-like text. The model in this application helps process and interpret document content, supporting various functionalities like question answering and document retrieval.

### Key Features of the LLM Model in DocuMate

- **Question Answering**: The LLM model can understand questions and retrieve relevant answers from the document context.
- **Contextual Understanding**: It considers the context within document sections, enabling precise responses for user queries.
- **Efficient Document Retrieval**: Combined with vector embeddings, the LLM can quickly locate and respond based on relevant document parts.

### How the LLM Model Works in DocuMate

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Uploaded PDFs are split into chunks and transformed into vector embeddings. This allows fast and accurate document retrieval based on user questions.
2. **Prompt-based Responses**: The model is prompted to answer questions strictly from the provided document context, ensuring responses are document-specific.
3. **Integration with LangChain**: By leveraging the LangChain library, DocuMate efficiently chains document retrieval and question-answering tasks using the LLM model, providing a seamless user experience.

### Why Use an LLM Model?

The LLM model brings advanced language processing capabilities to DocuMate, making it a powerful tool for:
- **Automated Document Analysis**: Users can get answers without manually searching through documents.
- **Customizable Prompting**: Adjust the modelâ€™s prompt settings to get responses tailored to specific needs.
- **Enhanced Retrieval Accuracy**: LLMs improve the accuracy of information retrieval, particularly when combined with embeddings and vector stores like FAISS.

### Limitations

While LLM models are powerful, they have some limitations:
- **Resource Intensity**: LLMs can be computationally demanding, which may impact performance for larger documents or high traffic.
- **Potential for Bias**: Since LLMs are trained on large, public datasets, they may carry biases present in the data.
- **Dependence on Prompting**: The quality of answers depends heavily on how prompts are structured, which requires careful customization for best results.

By integrating a state-of-the-art LLM, DocuMate aims to make document querying and analysis as smooth and accurate as possible for its users.
